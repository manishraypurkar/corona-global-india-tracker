corona-global-india-tracker covid-19 tracker designed and developed in PHP

In the proposed system, I designed and developed an open source project to keep track of all the coid-19 cases around the world and all states in india. This system is designed and developed using php and bootstrap, html technologies and deploying on cloud platform: HEROKU use as a PaaS (Platform as a services).

This is a project that keep track of all cases of covid-19 disease all around the world and india statewise manner. That monitoring and manages count of patients and
tracking of cases by different categories ie.

We use open source real time covid-19 dataset from government website and one from GitHub community. This dataset is retrieve using method of php ie filegetcontents(). This method return json object and this object after converted into php objects (Array). After converting into array we manipulate arrays and representing that data in the form of tables with the help of html and bootstrap.
